# admin-workflow #

Initial thoughts on what admin should do after receiving a Pull Request for a developer's feature branch.  I have not checked these for accuracy (do the commands accomplish what I say?), and I'm in the dark on best practices.

## Notify other admins that you are handling the request? ##
Perhaps notify everyone (other admins, the developer, all subscribers) by commenting on the Pull Request

## Initial review in [GitHub][] ##
Using the links in the Pull-Request email:
- Is the change desirable?  If not, comment on the request.
- Eyeball the diffs to see if the code is reasonable: Does it look like it will work? Is the quality reasonable?

## Review the changes on your local machine ##
(Nathan floated the idea that each admin should have two local MO repos:  (1) one for your own development work (and where you act like any other developer), (2) one for admin work (like checking and merging other developer's work).)

### Get the changes ###
- If you haven't done it already, add the developer's personal [GitHub][] repo as a remote of your local repo and get the developer's repo.  Then create a local feature branch and switch to it. Use a [Git GUI][] or:
```
git remote add <your name for the remote> git@github.com:<DeveloperGitUserName>/mushroom-observer.git
git fetch <remote> 
git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>
```
For instance, the following makes @JoeCohen's personal Github repository a remote (named "JoeCohen") of your local repo, and switches to its "myfix" branch:
```
git remote add git@github.com:JoeCohen/mushroom-observer.git
git fetch JoeCohen
git -b myfix JoeCohen/myfix
```
### Experiment with the changes ###

- run the MO test suite
- See if the change works as advertised
- Look for obvious bad side effects

## Add the changes to the [Official MO Repo][] ##
I'm again unsure of the best practice.  To be safe, it's probably best to  sync to the [Official MO Repo][] because if it changed, we need to make sure we're still compatible.  If everything's okay, merge the developer's work and push it to the [Official MO Repo][]. (If there are incompatibilties, either (a) the admin can fix them, complete the merge, and then push to the [Official MO Repo][], or (b) ask the developer to fix them.) Use a [Git GUI][] or 
```
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git merge <developer's feature branch>
git push origin
```
Do we need to do anything in [Github][] or [Pivotal Tracker][]?
